# Check My Fit

As part of the Data Science Specialization on Coursera from the John Hopkins university, the developing data products class has a project to get a little hands-on experience developing data products in Shiny and Slidify. 

This repo hosts the source code for the CheckMyFit Shiny app [CheckMyFit](https://github.com/MattDSquared/CheckMyFit/tree/master/CheckMyFit), along with an associated Slidify pitch to promote the app [CheckMyFit_Pitch](https://github.com/MattDSquared/CheckMyFit/tree/master/CheckMyFit_Pitch). Both pitch and app are fairly simplistic, but serve to work with various aspects of developing and sharing data products. 

Check out the compiled pitch at: http://rpubs.com/MattDSquared
